This case is attended with some singularity; fortunately for her, Mr. Recorder of Bristol has attended here, and has given such evidence upon the subject, as induces us to think that this woman ought to be acquitted; we are of opinion that as she was discharged by proclamation she was set at large by legal authority, she could not have continued in gaol if she chose it; therefore she is at large against her consent; we think her life is not to be taken away by this charge.', '                                                      NOT GUILTY            .', 'Court to Prisoner.                \xa0                  Ann                   Randall                                                                                       , you have been acquitted of a capital felony; but as it appears by the evidence of the Recorder of Bristol that you were discharged by lawful authority, the Court have therefore been of opinion that you ought not to forfeit your life for so being at large; yet you will be in danger of being apprehended and tried for being at large again; the safest way therefore for yourself, is, that you should remain in custody of the law now, in order to be sentSee original\xa0 out of the kingdom on your former sentence.', 'Tried by the London Jury before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.']
