I am sure that prisoner is the man, he was in the goal seven or eight months: he was pardoned, on condition of transportation for fourteen years. I saw him on board the ship, and have the captain's receipt for the body, but was busy getting the irons off, and did not see him sign it.", 'Prisoners Defence.', 'I was sent out of the land; I never received sentence of transportation.
