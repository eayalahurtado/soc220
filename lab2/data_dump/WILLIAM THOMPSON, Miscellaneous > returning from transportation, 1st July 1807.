I produce the certificate of the prisoner's former conviction at the Surrey assizes; I received it of Mr. Knapp, clerk of the Surrey assizes. (The certificate read.)", 'Q.

I am a constable of the police office, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel. On Sunday the 14th of June                   last, in company with my brother officer that is here, I went to \xa0No. 19, Roberts's-place, near the Commercial Road, Mile End Old Town, Middlesex                                                      . In consequence of a man being up the chimney when we took a prisoner the day before, I searched the front room in the first pair of stairs; I could not find him there. I then went into the back room, and underneath the bedstead I found him crawled up, under the head of the bedstead on the boards. I then called to my brother officer, I said here he is. I turned up the bedstead, and asked him what he came there for; he said he came to dine with a gentleman in the front room. What! I said, you come to dine with Finch; he said he did.", 'Q. Had you known him before. - A. No.', ' \xa0                  EDWARD                   SMITH                                                                                       .
