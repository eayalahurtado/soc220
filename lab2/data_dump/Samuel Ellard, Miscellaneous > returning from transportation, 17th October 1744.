Then the record of his receiving judgment of transportation for 7 years, was produced and read.', 'Eliz. Holmes, who was evidence against him in 1741, was produced, but could not be positive he was the identical person.', ' \xa0                  John                   King                                                                                        , who was also an evidence against him in 1741, said, he could not be positive to his person, for he thought the other was of a fairer complexion; but being afterwards asked, whether the person he was evidence against at that time had but one eye, [as is the case of the Prisoner] he said he believed he had but one eye.', ' \xa0                  Stephen                   Mcdaniel                                                                                         proved the taking him upon Ludgate-Hill, and that he showed him the certificate of his conviction; that he said, it was his misfortune, and he could not help it.
