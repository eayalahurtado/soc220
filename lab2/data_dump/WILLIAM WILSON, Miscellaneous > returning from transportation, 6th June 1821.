I am an officer. On the 9th of May I apprehended the prisoner in St. Luke's parish - I was in company with Armstrong and Mance. I produce a certificate of his former conviction, which I got from Mr. Shelton's office, and saw him sign it - (read) - he was searched, but nothing found on him; he made no resistance. I was in Court when he was tried before, and am certain he is the same man, I had known him for years; I had nothing to do with the trial, but recollect it was for stealing some things the property of                \xa0                  John                   Goldsmith                                                                                       .", '- it was in September, 1819. He was convicted.', ' \xa0                  JOHN                   WOODFIELD                                                                                       . I am captain of the Batavia hospital ship at Sheerness. I receive convicts on board who are in ill health. I took the prisoner on board as a servant, because he bore a good character at the hulks; he was nine months with me, and conducted himself very well all that time. I took him from the Retribution hulk, and employedSee original\xa0him as a personal servant; he went away on the 7th of September, without my knowledge - nobody else went at the same time. He got out of the cabin window, and, I suppose, got ashore by a boat. I am willing to take him back again, as he bore a good character.', ' \xa0                  JOSHUA                   ARMSTRONG                                                                                       . I assisted in taking the prisoner, in consequence of an advertizement in the Hue and Cry; he made no resistance, and nothing improper was found on him. We went to look after him for three or four months, to houses where bad characters associate, but could never find him at such places. I hear he has been at work ever since he came back. He had been that morning to see his mother, who was very ill, and near death. As far as I can judge, he had left off his bad associates - I have no doubt of it. He had some silver about him.', " \xa0                  JOHN                   MANCE                                                                                       . I have heard the account of the last witness - it is correct. We could never find the prisoner in bad company; we took him at his mother's - he behaved very well.", "Prisoner's Defence. During the time I have been at home I have been at work.", " \xa0                  JOHN                   CRICK                                                                                       . I am a watch-finisher, and live at No. 7, Orchard-street, St. Luke's. I have known the prisoner from the latter end of December; he worked with me from that time till he was apprehended. He came very regularly every day to work, Mondays as well as other days, and earned from 25 s. to 30 s. a week. I have no doubt but he would have continued with me, if he had not been apprehended. He came about seven o'clock every morning, and left about dusk, and sometimes brought his dinner with him. I believe he is single. I have had a dozen or eighteen watches about at times, and never missed any. I did not know him until he came to work for me. I am willing to employ him again, and have work for him now. I have frequently had 70 l. or 80 l. worth of property about, but always found him honest.", ' \xa0                  BARNARD                   LEVY                                                                                       . I am a watch maker. I only know the prisoner by his being recommended to me to work, about three months ago; I gave him some to do at home, and he finished it regularly. I was quite satisfied with his honesty, I and trusted him with watch-movements, which are not of much value.', '                                                                           GUILTY            . -                                                          DEATH            .
