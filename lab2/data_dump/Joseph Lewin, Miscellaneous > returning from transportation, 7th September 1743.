Then he crossed from one Side of the Way to the other. I came up with him, and seized him by the Collar, which gave Way, so I thrust my Knuckles into his Throat, he said, for God's-Sake let me go, I have done no Harm, I have only returned from Transportation; said I, I will stay till the Prosecutor comes up. The People bid him go, and the Mob grew outragious; when Mr Burdeaux came up, he desired I would assist him, and said, that the Prisoner had robbed him, and had returned from Transportation, and that he had threatned Destruction * to him and his Family: I pushed him along as fast as possible towards my Lord-Mayor's-House; the People called us all the Thief-takers they could think of; the Mob arose in Battle-array, so that I said to the Prosecutor, I would assist him no further; but he begged I would.

I shipped myself at Philadelhia, the 15th of March, and was to take a Loading of Tar, and then to go to Leith in Scotland. I said to the Captain, it was very dangerous for me to go to London, for I shall be taken up for returning from Transportation; he said I should never fair out of the Ship; he said he would put in at Cowes, and instead of going to Cowes, he came to London; so I ventured on Shore, and there was a Gentleman's Son who was going on Board a Man of War, and I was to go in his Room, and to have five Guineas for it, and was going to the White-Hart in Lemmon-Street about it. I was told to take Care not to come in Mr Burdeaux's Way; it was but the fifth Day that I had been in London; the Ship arrived at London the 10th, and I was taken the 27th.
