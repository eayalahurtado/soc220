I saw Mr. Rigg sign it.', '(The certificate read.)', 'Q. to Wilson. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. I know the person of the prisoner; I was present when he was tried and convicted. He was ordered to be transported for seven years.', 'Q. He was the person to whom that certificate applies - A. Yes.', 'Q. Did you deliver him over afterwards to the hulk for the purpose of being transported - A. I did, in the month of April, 1810. I delivered him at Portsmouth, in the execution of that judgement. I delivered him to Captain Thompson: he was captain of the Captivity hulk at that time; he is now dead. Since that time I have not seen him until he was taken up. I have no doubt at all that he is the man.', ' \xa0                  HARRY                   ADKINS                                                                                       .
