The three prisoners and I were in the shop together; but I cannot tell the time, because I am no scholar. We went on purpose to take what we could. Sometimes we looked at muslins, sometimes handkerchiefs, and sometimes we wanted neckcloths. Mrs. Kelly gave some things to                \xa0                  Sarah                                                                   M'Fall. Mrs. Perkins took one piece of neckcloths, Mrs. Kelly took another, and the other woman took another. They made a common practice of it. Some of the goods were pawned; some were sold. Mrs. Perkins pawned them all that were pawned; and she sold the others, and the money was divided among us. I had part of it, as far as it went. M'Fall had some of it. I went along with Perkins when she pawned seventeen yards of muslin, in Bishopsgate-street.", ' \xa0                  John                   Delafare                                                                                        . I am a pawnbroker, in Bishopsgate-street. (He produced thirteen pieces of muslins and lawns.) Mrs. Perkins pawned these with me at different times. The 28th of March next will be two years since she brought some of them: the last was about November was twelvemonths. She used to tell me she brought them for one Mr. Scott in Hoxton-market-place, a man that deals in drapery.', 'Prosecutor. All these pieces I can swear to: there are my marks upon them all. This pawnbroker has three times as many, which I left, they not having my marks on them; I do not swear to them, but I think they are mine. I have seen Kelly in my shop within this month.', 'Q. to Delafore. To what amount might Perkins and you have dealt thus?', "Delafore. I believe we may have dealt to the amount of about 20 l. Egan was never in my shop but once, and that was with Perkins; then she brought seventeen yards of muslin. She said it was worth 9 s. a yard. I lent her 3 l. 8 s. upon it. She told me that was Mr. Scott's. Egan never said a word: she said he wanted money to make up a bill.", 'Prosecutor.
