You will consider, that the faults of some of you, are very considerably increased, from your having experienced that mercy already, as the sentence of transportation itself, to some of you, who were capitallySee original\xa0 convicted, was rather a condition of that mercy, than a mode of punishment: You will consider likewise, that it is not the offence of a single individual, but the offence of numbers who have violently arisen upon the Captain, taken possession of the ship, and in defiance of the laws of their country, and in elusion of its executive justice, have set themselves at liberty: Under these circumstances therefore, it is more than probable, that his Majesty's pleasure for your execution, will be very shortly notified; it behoves you therefore to improve the short interval that is left you, and having forfeited the peace of the world, to obtain the peace of the Almighty: You will remember however, that that peace is to be obtained only by sincere repentance, contrition, and prayers, and that these have no efficacy, unless they are founded upon a just, and in this instance, the deepest sense of guilt. With a recommendation to you, to awaken and confirm in yourselves those dispositions, which are most likely to obtain the pardon of an all just, and an all-merciful Deity, the Court pronounces the dreadful sentence of the law upon you. The sentence of the law is, and this Court doth adjudge, that you be respectively hanged by the necks until you are dead, and may God have mercy upon your souls!"]
