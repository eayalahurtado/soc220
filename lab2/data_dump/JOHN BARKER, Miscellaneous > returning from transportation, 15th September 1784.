(The record read) I put the prsoner and another to be tried for a highway robbery, in September Session, 1783, I do not remember the day, but in December, in the same year, I put him to the bar, he received a pardon upon condition of being transported for seven years, and in my hearing he accepted the pardon, I am sure he is the same man; on the 31st of August on the left hand of \xa0Shire-lane                                                       going up, me and Macmanus, in company with others, met the prisoner about half past twelve, he had his handkerchief up to his mouth, when I first saw him I did not know him, but as soon as he took the handkerchief from his mouth, I knew him, and I said, what Barker, what do you do here, he in reply, says, my name is not Barker, I says, yes it is Jack, and you must go with me, and I took him to the watch-house immediately.', ' \xa0                  PATRICK                   MACMANUS                                                                                        sworn.', 'I have nothing to say, only I was out that night that Barker was taken, I can say nothing more to the business.', 'Prisoner. There may be another Barker besides me, I had people to attend here but they are gone.', 'After the Court summed up the evidence, the Foreman of the Jury said, My Lord, the Jury beg to withdraw.', "Court. After having stated the evidence short, it does not become me to press any thing further to you, it is for your discretion, but it is my duty to say to you, this is the usual course of evidence, in cases of this sort, at the same time it is totally in your breasts, to say you are satisfied or not; and you are not bound to give your verdict, because numberless other Juries have given their verdict upon evidence of the same kind; for my own part, I never feel any difficulty when in a capital case, where a man's life is concerned, and a Jury pauses so considerably as you do, in such a case I never hesitate to recommend it to them to acquit the prisoner.", '                                                      GUILTY            ,                                                          Death            .', 'Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr.                \xa0                  Baron                   HOTHAM                                                                                       .']
