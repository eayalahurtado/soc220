On 7th April last I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of St. Mark\'s Road, Camberwell, about 350 yards from 45, Grosvenor Park—I had ascertained that he was living there—I was in company with another officer—I said to him "Mr. Powell, I believe?"—he said "Yes"—I said "We are two detective officers, and are going to arrest you for being at large when on return from transportation in the name of Leeson"—I took hold of his arm—he said "What name did you say?"—I said "Leeson"—he said "Don\'t hold me, I will go with you"—after we had gone a little way he said "A convict! that is nice, very nice! this is a mistake, and a very unpleasant one for me"—we got into a cab, and on the way he said "I suppose it is no use my asking you gentlemen at whose instigation this is?"—he was taken to Bow Street Station, and from there to Tottenham Court Road—he was there placed with about eight or ten other persons, and Superintendent Thompson picked him out as Charles Leeson—next morning I examined the prisoner\'s arms; on the left arm there was an urn tattooed, something after this style (producing a paper)—this is a sketch of it that I made—on the right arm there was a cross with the letters "C. G." or "G. G." on the top, and under it "I. H. S." and "M. M."—I subsequently went to 45, Grosvenor Park, Walworth, with Inspector O\'Callaghan, and assisted to search the place—O\'Callaghan found what he will produce.', " Cross-examined. I have been in the force 17 years—I do not know when the Government ceased to send convicts to Australia—I had nothing to do with the trial at Manchester—I first learnt that we were to look for the Manchester convict about the middle of March; Inspector O'Callaghan told me of it—other officers were present—Oscar Ruman was not present—I don't know him; I never heard of him in connection with the police—since the middle of March I have discussed this matter with O'Callaghan, it might be two or three times a week—I went over and kept observation two or three times—I was engaged at Sessions at different times, or he would have been arrested before—I went into a private house in this instance under O'Callaghan's directions without any Magistrate's warrant or Secretary of State's order, or without the knowledge of Mr. Howard Vincent—I am still acting under O'Callaghan's directions—I saw him lay his hands on a woman and search and carry away papers—Sergeant Berry was with me in the cab, not O'Callaghan—since I first examined the prisoner's arms I have made a further examination—I first called the mark something like basket-work—I have not taken any persons to Newgate to identify the prisoner—I believe persons have been sent; I don't know their names.", '  \xa0                                                                        JAMES JACOB THOMPSON                  . I am now Superintendent of the E Division—in 1866 I was an Inspector of the Detective Department at Scotland Yard; in that year I arrested two persons in London connected with a charge of breaking and entering a warehouse in the country—the prisoner is one of those persons—I knew him then in the name of Charles Leeson; he was then keeping a beershop in the Kennington Road—I arrested him there; I took him to the police-station in a cab—he was afterwards charged before Sir Thomas Henry—I was present and saw him, and again on remand, and then I took him to Manchester—I saw him', "when he was examined there before the Magistrate from time to time, and was present at his trial with three others before Mr. Justice Blackburn; the trial lasted several days—I was in Court from day to day and saw him there—I have no doubt whatever that he is the man—I produce the certificate of his conviction; his sentence was 15 years' penal servitude—he had been previously convicted as Charles Kelly in August, 1858, and sentenced to seven years (These certificates were put in and read)—I think I saw him afterwards at Millbank with the others, but I am not sure—in April last I saw him at the Tottenham Court Road Police-station in custody—there were a number of other persons there—I recognised him at once.", ' Cross-examined. The arrest was early in September, 1866—I had seen him previous to that—I had occasion to keep observation on him for three weeks or a month—I was present at his trial with three others—it lasted four days—I believe I saw him after at Millbank for a few minutes or half an hour, early in 1867—since then I have never seen him till this year—I stated in cross-examination in April that on taking the Manchester convict in September, 1866, I went with him to the station in a cab with Sergeant Potter and a private constable—I said, "I am less sure about Potter being there, and still less sure about the private constable"—I think I also said there was another constable, but I could not give his letter or number—I have no doubt Potter was there—I think what I said was that I was less sure of Potter than I was of the constable; I did not say I was not sure of him—I said to Sir James Ingham that to the best of my belief the prisoner was the man—my belief at the time was very strong; I am, if possible, more sure to-day—I said at the Tottenham Court Road Station, "My belief is a very strong one that you are the man, but I should be unwilling to swear with absolute certainty"—I do not remember a case of the police being put on taking a convict into custody 13 years after his conviction; such cases have happened, I can\'t call them to mind at this moment—I do not know the statute by which whoever shall discover and prosecute to conviction in such a case shall be entitled to 20l. reward—I am not the author of first looking after the prisoner; the information was sent to the Director of Criminal Investigations, who referred the matter to me, and in the ordinary course of police duty I placed the case in the hands of O\'Callaghan and subject to my directions he acted in the matter—I gave him no directions till Powell was in custody—it was to some extent without my cognisance that he forced his way into a private house, and laid his hands on a woman, and took away papers—I should say that is a thing not done without a warrant—I do not know the exact number of persons who have been taken to Newgate to try and identify the prisoner; I should think over 10—the larger portion have not identified him—I do not know that the Governor of Newgate differs from the police as to the marks on the prisoner; it has not been reported to me—I do not know the exact period when transportation ceased. I should think about 1865.', "  \xa0                                                                        JOHN HOOK                  . I am principal warder at Millbank—I knew the prisoner by the name of Charles Leeson at Millbank—I received him there on 20th December, 1866—he left on 30th September, 1867—at that time I was master cooper in the artisans' yard—the prisoner was brought there to work as a paperhanger—I used to see him every day and twice a day except on Sunday, I don't know that I always saw him on Sundays—I", 'have no doubt about his being the man—I was one of the escort that took him and other convicts down to Sheerness—I saw him there on board the Hugenot, or Hugemot—some old pensioners on board took charge of the convicts—that was the last I saw of the prisoner until I saw him at Bow Street on 14th April last; he was then in the passage of the Court, standing among several more men, I could not tell how many—I was called out to see if I could recognise a man, and I went and touched the prisoner, and said "That is a man I know by the name of Leeson"—I produce the register of the marks of the convicts, kept by one of the clerks—I don\'t know whether the clerk who made this entry is dead—the clerk who signs his name here is Cannon.', ' Cross-examined. The man I have been speaking of was received from Manchester—he was a very handy, industrious fellow, one of the best conducted men I ever had under my control—I have seen him at work with his shirt sleeves turned up—I never took any notice of any marks on him—I first knew that I was wanted as a witness against Powell on Wednesday, 13th April—I had a subpoena from the Treasury—Bryce did not speak to me before that—he spoke to me about a man named Leeson, not Powell; he said Leeson was in custody, and that he was at the House of Detention under remand—that was before I saw this man at all—the Manchester convict went down to Sheerness with some 50 other convicts, I believe—the old pensioners were on board when we arrived—I am not aware that any of them are here, they went out to stop in the country—I am not aware that any of the officers of the ship are here, or anybody but warders and police—I did not see the ship sail.', ' Re-examined. I had nothing to do with examining the marks on prisoners.', '  \xa0                                                                        BENJAMIN BRYCE                  . I am principal warder at Millbank Prison—I have been there since 1864—I knew the prisoner there from December, 1866, to September, 1867, in the name of Charles Leeson—I saw him daily, and several times during the day—I remember a batch of convicts going from the prison to Australia—I was not present when Leeson went away—I have so doubt about the prisoner being the Charles Leeson who was there—I did not go down to Sheerness—on Monday, 11th April last, I went to the House of Detention and saw the prisoner there—I should say there were from 100 to 130 there—I recognised him—he was about the third or fourth man that passed me when I got into the yard—they were marching round—I called him out.', ' Cross-examined. I cannot tell when transportation to the colonies practically ceased—I read in the newspaper that Leeson was in custody, on the Sunday before I went to the House of Detention—I once made a mistake in a man, as to a previous conviction.', ' Re-examined. I went to the House of Detention in the ordinary course of my duty, when I saw the prisoner—I called him out and asked him his name; he said his name was Charles Leeson Powell.', "  \xa0                                                                        FREDERICK LIGGINS                  . I am a warder of Her Majesty's Prison at Manhester—in 1867 I was warder in the convict prison at Fremantle, Western Australia—I remember a man named Charles Leeson coming to that as a convict—he was not under my immediate notice there; he was in the prison where I was; I saw him there from time to time—I see him now; it is the prisoner—I went to Newgate, and recognised him—I did not recognise him at first; he has got a great deal stouter than he was; his face is fuller—I now say he is the man.", " Cross-examined. I went to Australia in 1863 as a warder—I was not always at Fremantle—I went there in the beginning of 1868—I was not there when the ship containing the 50 convicts arrived; I was up the country—the convicts were called by names, and not by numbers—Leeson was not under my immediate charge—sometimes when up the country we had from 20 to 50 under our charge for months together—I returned to Fremantle in 1868, and did not go up country again—we generally had between 400 and 500 under charge at Fremantle—I never left Fremantle again until I left for England in 1872—I saw Charles Leeson plenty of days, I might say a score perhaps; I saw him called out on the parade ground—I never saw a photograph of him there—I first heard that I was wanted to go to Newgate yesterday week—I was brought up from Manchester—I saw a paragraph in the Guardian newspaper that somebody was wanted to identify him, and I thought I could do so—two other persons went with me to Newgate, Robinson and Handy, I think, no one else; yes, Mr. O'Callaghan did, but he did not go in, he stopped outside—I am not aware that I have talked to the officers about the man—I think I gave a description of him, I might have done so, to O'Callaghan—he did not give any description to me.", "  \xa0                                                                        THOMAS HANDY                  . I was an officer in Millbank—I have retired on a pension—this book (produced) is the reception ward book, where all prisoners' names are entered—this entry was made by me as to the convicts' religious professions; I made it at the time when I was chief warder in the prison—the officer who accompanied me is here.", "  \xa0                                                                        EDWARD CANNON                  . I am chief clerk at Bostall Prison, Kent—I was formerly a clerk in Millbank Prison—it was my duty to make an entry of the religions of the convicts—I find in this register an entry of the name of Charles Leeson with my signature—there are other entries made by H. T. Graham; he was an assistant warder at that time; he left the prison shortly after that date, and I don't know what has become of him—I only see the prisoners just to make this entry as to their religion; I do not see them from day to day—I do not profess to identify anybody.", " Cross-examined. I did not write this down from what the chief warder told me—it is the prisoner's declaration with regard to his religion, made to the chief warder, or deputy-governor, or whoever may be present, and I wrote it down at the time in this book.", "  \xa0                                                                        EDWARD ROBINSON                  . I am chief warder of Her Majesty's Prison at Walton, near Liverpool—I know the prisoner—I produce a certificate of the conviction of Charles Gleeson in October, 1854, at the Liverpool Quarter Sessions; the prisoner is the person—I was present at the trial—he was sentenced to be imprisoned for two years with hard labour and to be whipped—he served his term in the Walton Prison; during these two years I saw him every day, and very often several times a day—I saw him after the expiration of that sentence, in December, 1866, at the Manchester Assizes, when he was tried in the name of Charles Leeson, and sentenced to 15 years' penal servitude—I then proved this conviction against him—I recently went to Newgate—I saw about 30 persons there, the prisoner amongst them; I pointed him out to the governor—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I knew him before 1854.", ' Cross-examined. I was asked to come up some time last week; they', "wrote to the head of the police at Liverpool, and he wrote to our governor—I have never seen the prisoner since 1866 until I saw him in Newgate—I saw in the paper that Charles Leeson Powell was in custody, and that he was charged as being the man who was convicted in 1866—I did not come in contact with any of the police-officers here when I came up; I reported myself to the governor of the gaol—I saw Mr. Batchelor, who is conducting the case for the Treasury, and I saw O'Callaghan—no one went to Newgate with me.", "  \xa0                                                                        JAMES COLLINS                  . I live at 5, Cook's Road, Kennington Park Road—at the end of October last I was employed by Mr. Gabb to do some work at 45, Grosvenor Road, a private house—I saw the prisoner there—he was not occupying the house at that time; he was moving to 45 from another number in the same road—I helped to move a safe for him—he resided at No. 45 during the latter part of the time I was at work there—there was a lady there passing as his wife, Mrs. Powell; they occupied the house during the time I was working there—I had not seen Mr. Powell about the neighbourhood before October—I went to do some repairs at 45; he merely passed the time of day when I saw him, we had no conversation—I lent a hand one morning moving the safe to 45; a man went with me, and helped to move it—I worked there for a fortnight or three weeks; I saw Powell there constantly—I do not know that he ever slept in the house—I went there at 7 in the morning, and came away at 6—the lady answered to the name of Mrs. Powell.", '  \xa0                                                                        JOHN O\'CALLAGHAN                  . (Police Inspector E). I was at Bow Street Station when the prisoner was brought in on April 7, about 2 in the afternoon; Sergeant Header was present—I said to the prisoner "I understand you deny being the man;" he said "I have said nothing, I don\'t know who you take me for, or what the charge is"—I said "We say you are Charles Powell, who was convicted in Belgium in February, 1878, and liberated from there about four months ago. The charge against you now is that you are at large while under sentence of transportation;" he said "They have told me that already, it is very vague"—I said "We believe that as Charles Leeson you were convicted at Manchester for a stamp robbery in 1866, and sentenced to 15 years\' transportation, and that you escaped from Western Australia in 1869;" he said "I have heard all you say, and I say nothing"—I was present when he was formally charged at the station—he was asked by the inspector his age, name, and address; he said "I decline to make any statement whatever"—after he was in custody he was visited by a woman in the cell—before she came I went to 45, Grosvenor Road, Camberwell—I there saw that same woman—I found a safe there, and at my request she opened it, and I found there these documents, amongst them these two receipts.', ' MR. BESLEY objected to these being received in evidence in the absence of proof by the person making them, and under the circumstances in which they were taken possession of by the witness, there being no actual proof that the safe in which they were found was the property of the prisoner. The RECORDER declined to admit them.', ' MR. BESLEY called attention to the 5th Geo. IV., c.. 84, sec.. 22, by which two classes of persons were intended to be reached, and submitted that the prosecution must make up their minds to which class they alleged the prisoner to belong.', ' MR. POLAND contended that this was not a ease under the 5th Geo. IV., where a person agreed to banish himself, but by the Penal Servitude Act, 20 and 21 Vic., penal servitude was the same as a sentence of transportation, and that the authorities could send prisoners beyond the seas as if they had been sentenced for transportation.', ' The COURT decided that the case must go to the Jury, but the onus of proof lay with the prosecution.', '                                                                      NOT GUILTY                  .']
