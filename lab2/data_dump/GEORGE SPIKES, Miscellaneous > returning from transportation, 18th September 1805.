When I left the goal, I was sworn into His Majesty's service at the Office, in Queen-square; I was to have five guineas bounty, but four pounds eighteen shillings and sixpence of the said sum went to pay the goal-fees, and your prisoner received the overplus, thinking to serve His Majesty, your prisoner was disappointed, the serjeant of the Marines knew me to be a deserter, and directly went and informed the Colonel that there was a deserter; the Colonel asked Serjeant Taylor, of the                \xa0                  Brown                   Bear                                                                                       , Bow-street, who enlisted us, what we were; Serjeant Taylor said, we were all prisoners, and had received His Majesty's pardon; the Colonel-Major replied, you are all thieves, and reprimanded the serjeant for not shewing the copy of our pardon; the Colonel asked us what we were there for; your prisoner was the first he asked; I told him it was for a slight offence, I was sworn to be a person that stole a roll of cloth; I was ordered to the Guardroom, and was to have been tried by a Court-Martial at Chatham barracks, but the Court-Martial did not take place; they detained us, and called us thieves, which made our lives miserable, but my companions were fortunate, and your prisoner was rejected; the Colonel was exasperated at my not having shewn the things that our bounty would have purchased; he would have nothing to do with me. I leave it to the mercy of the Court, I am an unfortunate person; I was guilty of being charged with a felony in April Sessions, and I have suffered by the civil law.", '                                                      GUILTY            ,                                                          Death            , aged 17.', 'Second Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Justice Heath.']
