['Before Mr. Recorder.', '1395.                \xa0                  GEORGE                   STUART, alias                         JOHN GEORGE STIPLER                                                                                             , was indicted for                                                          feloniously being at large without lawful cause, he having been convicted of felony, and ordered to be transported for the term of his natural life            .', 'MR. ADOLPHUS conducted the Prosecution.', 'MR.                \xa0                  JOHN                   STAFFORD                                                                                       . I produce a certificate of the conviction of George Stuart - I saw it signed by Mr.                \xa0                  John                   Clark                                                                                       , the deputy clerk of assize of the home circuit - I obtained it at his office from himself (Read.)', ' \xa0                  JOHN                   SMART                                                                                       . In 1817, I was keeper of the County Gaol, at Horsham - in the spring assizes, that year, George Stuart was committed to my custody - he was tried at the spring assizes that year, and pleaded guilty to the indictment - he was afterwards reprieved, and I put him on board the Captivity, off Portsmouth, on the 6th of May - I have an acknowledgment, which I took from the hulk, for him among other prisoners whom I delivered there - I cannot recollect who gave me the receipt, but I had it on board the ship.', 'Q. Allowing for the change seventeen years make in a man, look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you believe him to be the man? A. I am inclined to think so, but I should not like to swear it - seventeen years is a great while.', ' \xa0                  JOHN                   NEWMAN                                                                                       . In 1817, I was guard on board the Captivity hulk - I am now chief mate of the Leviathan - I remember Smart bringing a number of transports on board our ship, from Sussex - this is the receipt given for them - I have a perfect recollection of the prisoner - I have not a doubt of his being one of the men brought by Smart on that occasion - he was sent to New South Wales, in the ship Lorkins - I speak from a perfect recollection of his person - he is the man and no other.', 'Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you go out with convicts? A. Not now - I did then - I did not go out of the country with the Lorkins - he was on board the Captivity from the 6th of May till the 11th of July - and then went in the Lorkins - I cannot tell how many men there were - they were brought at different times - I cannot tell how many were brought at one time - Smart and other people brought them, but generally Smart - he always had assistants with him - I cannot say whether he always came - I am certain Smart came when Stuart came - I cannot exactly remember the names of the others that came - I remember the person of Richard Stuart, who came with him - there was something remarkable in it, as they were supposed to be soldier officers - their manner, dress, and appearance, were respectable, and they were particularly noticed - many persons came to see them.', 'Q. Have you ever stated that Stuart had a wen on his hand? A. I have said so - according to the written description given, it was so, but a wen can be removed without incision - there was a projection on his right hand - that I have a distinct recollection of - he had a projection, whether from a strain or not, I cannot say - I do not know that I ever said myself that it was a wen - it was entered in the description book as a wen, by the steward of the ship - I have looked at the description book since my attention has been called to the prisoner, but I had a perfect recollection of him before that; and having seen it in the Hue and Cry, I was first applied to about this, in July last - I had not then seen him for seventeen years - I saw him in Newgate on this charge, not before - I was not in London till I was called on this occasion - I should think not less than 8,000 male convicts have passed through my observation since 1817.', 'MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume Smart only brought the convicts from Sussex? A. Certainly, no others - he brought the Sussex convicts generally, and I believe always - I never had the least hesitation or doubt of the prisoner - when I heard he had escaped from New South Wales, which was about 1829, I said, I should know that man again, see him whenever I might - I believe it was 1829.', "MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you remember seeing him in Newgate? A. Yes; I saw him in the presence of Mr. Cope, in July - I said, in Mr. Cope's presence, that I should know him by a wen on his hand.", 'Q. Did not you speak with hesitation about his identity until you looked at his hand to see if there was a wen? A. No; at his first appearance, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - I had no hesitation about him - I said I should know him by the wen, but as soon as he entered the door, I said, "That is the man, I will swear to him" - it was before that, I said I should know him by the wen on his hand - I believe it was before I saw him, I said so - I examined his hand to look for a wen, after I had expressed my confident opinion that it was him.', 'MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a wen on his hand when you examined him? A. No; I had not the least doubt of him - I know him by his face and his make, independently of the wen.', ' See original\xa0MR. BODKIN. Q. Is there, according to the practice, a reward given on conviction of persons under these circumstances? A. I am not aware that there is, I have no knowledge of it - I have never been on a trial of the sort - I am certain there is no reward for me - I have heard of rewards being given, but I do not know it for a fact - I never knew any one receive it - I do not expect to get one farthing.', ' \xa0                  JOHN                   BARKER                                                                                       . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner in High-street, Shadwell, in Middlesex.', "Prisoner's Defence. The time from the first conviction of the individual named, is seventeen years - there is no evidence but the guard - you have heard his observation as to not expecting a reward: till that question was put, it must have entered your minds that he was influenced by the hope of reward or favour of some kind - how is it to be supposed that a man can take on himself, after seventeen years, to swear to an individual he never saw since? - would any of you gentlemen do it? and, if not, you ought to consider that no other man could conscientiously do it - therefore you will be pleased to weigh the matter in your minds - here is an elderly man, whose foot is on the border of the grave, he will not attempt to do it; but the other man is in the habit of guarding felons, and has become as callous as any of them.", ' \xa0                  JOHN                   CARPUE                                                                                       , Esq. I am a surgeon.', 'Q. In your judgment, can a wen or excrescence be moved from the hand of a man, without leaving some mark? A. I have paid great attention to such cases - I must say, though surgery has advanced very much indeed, we have not the art of disguising an operation, so much as to leave no mark - it is my decided opinion if a wen is taken off, you must see a mark.', 'Q. Supposing it was a swelling, which exhibited a general appearance of a wen to an uninformed person, might that be removed without a mark? A. Certainly; I am assuming there was a wen; then there must be an incision.', "MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. An ignorant person might call that a wen which is not one? A. Certainly; all I say is, if there was an incision, there must be a mark - there has been no operation on the prisoner's hand.", 'JOHN NEWMAN re-examined. When the convicts are brought on board, they are generally examined by a surgeon, but not so particularly at that time as they are now - the description entered in the book is done by the surgeon.', 'MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether it was a wen do you know? A. I do not - the steward keeps the book - I recollect a projection on the back of his right hand, but I think it must have been a sprain.', 'MR. CARPUE. A wen may be taken up into the system, and not be taken off by an operation.', '                                                      NOT GUILTY            .']
