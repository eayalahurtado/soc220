I apprehended the prisoner for the fact he was tried for, and was present when he was tried. There were two indictments against him; one for stealing goods, the property of Mr. Tyley; but I did not see him receive sentence.', ' \xa0                  Christopher                   Reed                                                                                        . The prisoner was put on board my ship. I carried him to Maryland, and set him on shore there the 5th of July last, among the other transports. I remember him well: he rased a riot in the Downs, and got himself to be what he called the captain; but they were soon subdued again.', " \xa0                  William                   Noel                                                                                        . I carried the prisoner on shore from the Triall, the ship he returned here in at Blackwall. She arrived the 27th of Dec. last. The prisoner asked liberty for the ship's boat to go on shore for strong beer. I went on shore with him. He stayed on shore, and would not go on board again. He said he would go to London. We got the ship up to Bell Wharf. I was sent on shore, and when I came on board, the prisoner, whom I had met on shore, was got on board. I told Captain Reed he was on board the ship; he said, that is the man that made himself captain of his ship. He ordered me to carry him on shore, and see that he had justice done him.", "Prisoner's Defence.", 'The captain took me prisoner on board.', '                                                      Guilty            ,                                                          Death            .']
