I apprehended him, and put him upon a coach, and coming through Kensington he jumped off the coach with his hands tied, I jumped off and caught him going down the lane into Fulham Field, he made use of a desparate oath, and said,", '"if it was your case you would do the same, and try to get off, if I am taken my case is desperate, I have served four years." I brought him back, and put him on the coach again, and took him to the office.
