When I received my sentence on the 13th of January, 1802, I applied to Lord Pelham to be liberated upon my departing the kingdom, which his Lordship granted; I was liberated upon condition that I should depart the kingdom; I applied to the Secretary of State's Office for a passport, not being successful, he informed me there would be no danger if I went to Paris; I went on board the King George, and arrived in France; I was summoned before the Commissary, I told him I had no passport, and that I had been an officer; he said, if I would enrol myself in the 28th brigade, then lying at Paris, I might continue there, if not, he must send me on board without a passport; I thought in my own conscience, perhaps, in a short time, I might be placed in such a situation as to fight against the British colours, which, in my own conscience, I would not do; I wrote to captain Roach, and desired him to get a pardon for me from Lord Pelham. I was summoned before the Consul, and told him I was a free man; the Consul said, I was not a free man, and that he would send me back in a transport; I was put on board, and came to London, and took a lodging, I never returned on my own account; and if I would have accepted of that infamous offer, of accepting a commission in the 28th brigade, to fight against the British colours, I might have continued there; therefore your Lordship cannot think I have misused that goodness which has been shewn me; I never should have been here could I have obtained a passport from Government.", '                                                      GUILTY            ,                                                          Death            .', 'First Middlesex Jury, before Mr. Baron Hotham.']
