I know the prisoner; he was capitally convicted; I know nothing of the transportation; I took him at the time he was tried for stealing the mare; I am sure he is the same person; I saw him several times besides being in Court at the time he was tried. I took him at the Old George in Oxford-road; that was the time he was first taken; Heley took him now.', ' \xa0                  John                   Heley                                                                                       .

I assisted Heley in taking the prisoner on Westminster Bridge.', "Prisoner's Defence.", 'I own myself the person, and leave it to the mercy of the Court; I was very ill used in the country and was glad to get home again.
