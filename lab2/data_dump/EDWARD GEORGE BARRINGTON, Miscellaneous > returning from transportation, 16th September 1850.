I was present at the June Session, 1844, at this Court, when the prisoner was tried and sentenced to ten years' transportation. On Saturday, 24th Aug. last, I saw him in Leonard-street, near Leonard-square, Shoreditch—he was walking at large towards his residence—I took him into custody, and told him it was for running away from Western Australia—he said he was pardoned, and he could show me his ticket—I told him he must do so, but he must go first to the station—he then said it was that b—y rogue Charley that had sold him—I produce a certificate of his conviction—(read, Edward George Barrington, Convicted June, 1844, and ordered to be transported for ten years)—I saw Mr. Clark sign this paper.", ' Cross-examined by MR. DIGBY SEYMOUR. Q. There was no previous conviction against the prisoner then? A. No; as soon as he was arrested, he said that he was pardoned, and that he had his ticket—he did not say that he had had his ticket—I believe he was partner with his brother Charles—when he was tried he was sent to the Model-prison—I believe he went to Western Australia—I do not know that he received a ticket of leave for good conduct.', '  \xa0                                                                        JOHN JENKINS                  . I am the principal warder of the Model-prison, at Pentonville. The prisoner was received there on 2nd Sept., 1844, and remained there till 6th Oct., 1845—he was then removed to the Cumberland for Western Australia.', ' Cross-examined. Q. He came to the Model-prison from Millbank? A. Yes; I do not know how many persons went out along with him in the Cumberland—he received a ticket of leave, and was sent abroad with that party, in consequence of his good conduct—he went in the capacity of a millwright to Western Australia—he had a working dress and another dress, the same as the others had—his conduct was good from the time of his apprehension.', ' GUILTY.
