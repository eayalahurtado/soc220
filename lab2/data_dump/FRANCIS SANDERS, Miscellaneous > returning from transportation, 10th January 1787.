Gentlemen, the single question for you to determine is, whether this man is the same man that was tried at the time stated in the indictment, which was September, 1785, and received sentence of transportation, and whether he was at large within the kingdom without any lawful cause within that time; now it is proved, that he is the same man that was tried, and received such sentence, and it is proved that he was apprehended at large before the expiration of that term; now the cause that he himself alledges, does not go to an absolute defence, even if his witnesses were here to prove it; therefore if you believe these witnesses, it proves him guilty of the charge.', 'Jury. We wish to know whether he was ill down to the time he was to transport himself.', 'Court. It is clear no sickness would amount to an acquittal, except such as clearly rendered it impossible: now he himself states that he was ill two months; he was discharged in March, and apprehended in November.', 'GUILTY,                                                          Death            .', 'He was                                                          humbly recommended to mercy by the Jury            .', 'Court. There will be an opportunity of enquiring into the truth of the fact, for the information of his Majesty.', 'Court to Prisoner.
