With submission being deprived of my parents at the early part of my life, and left without a protector or adviser, I unfortunately deviated from the path of rectitude. On the report being made to his Majesty, he was graciously pleased to spare my life, and by the humane benevolent interposition of the Recorder of London, I experienced a further extenuation of Royal clemency, and was pardoned, on condition of serving in the army abroad. In the month of August, 1811, I quitted London for the Isle of Wight, where I served six months to the entire satisfaction of my superior. On my embarking for the regiment that I was attached to, I not only received a certificate of good conduct, but was permitted to take my wife with me to the West Indies, and on joining my regiment, no man could devote himself more chearfully than I did to my duty, for which I had the happiness of obtaining the good opinion of my officers, so as to be selected myself and wife for an important situation in the family of Sir                \xa0                  Alexander                   Cochrane                                                                                       , who was then govenour of the Island. I unfortunately fell ill and was obliged to be removed to what was considered a more healthy situation; my constitution however would not bear the climate; and after four attacks of the fever, I was reduced to the very verge of the grave, and no hopes of avoiding speedy dissolution but by flight: I was tempted to desert to save my life, after having served most faithfully and zealonsly, as far as healt would admit. I returned to my native country, without friends or the means of existance, my character being gone, and fearing to shew myself where I could gain an honest livelihood.", 'COLONEL MAHONE. I belong to the regiment of Royal York-rangers. I was at Barbadoes; the prisoner was a private soldier in the Royal York-rangers nearly two years. I speak from recollection, I have no document, his conduct was that of a good soldier, I heard no complaint against him; if there had been I must have heard it, I had such an opinion of the man, that he and his wife were selected to serve in the Govenours house; the man and his wife conducted themselves with propriety, they merited every attentton. I could bestow upon them.', 'Q. Had he the yellow fever - A. I cannot take upon me to say, every man in that part has; I think it is more provable that he had, he was of a weak habit.', '                                                      GUILTY             -                                                          DEATH            , aged 31.', 'London jury, before Mr. Common Serjeant.']
