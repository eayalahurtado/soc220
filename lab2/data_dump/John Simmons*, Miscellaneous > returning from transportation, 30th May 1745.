It was the 18th of March between twelve and one in the morning; I was informed there was a quarrel in the alehouse; I went there, and they charged me with the Prisoner at the bar. He gave me good words, and said, he would stay till the constable came; but all on a sudden he got from me, and cut me cross the head with a knife; then he gave me a cut cross my wrist, and cut the leaders of my arm, and I am afraid I shall never have the use of it again.', "Q.

Only by his living some time in the neighbourhood. I went along with her, and going along I said to him, how could you be so unkind as to make such a disturbance and a noise at this time o'night? When I came to the publick house, he wanted to run away, but I took hold of his collar, and he knocked me down; this was at the alehouse. My watchmen hearing that I was in a fray came to my assistance; but the prisoner being a stout, lusty fellow (and, as I suppose, fearing something of danger if he was taken) knocked me down again, and run away.", 'Prisoner.
