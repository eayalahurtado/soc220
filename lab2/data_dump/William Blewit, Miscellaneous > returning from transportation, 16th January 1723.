[" \xa0                     William                      Blewit                                                                                                          , was also indicted for                                                          returning from Transportation without License            . The Prisoner pleaded in Excuse, that he had been very serviceable in his Voyage, having his Liberty given him to assist in keeping his Fellow Felons transported with him; and that, when they mutiny'd in their Passage, and would have kill'd the Master and Ship's Crew, and tied them back to back, and thrown them into the Sea. He had prevented it, and saved the Ship's Crew and Cargoe. He call'd Merchant Forward as a Witness but he depos'd That tho' he had been appointed to have his Liberty on Board of Ship, in order to assist in the Management of the Felons, yet he knew not what he said to be true, as to his preventing the Loss of Ship's crew and Cargo, the Ship not being yet return'd from Nevis, tho' He had been landed there and was come back.                                                          Death            ."]
