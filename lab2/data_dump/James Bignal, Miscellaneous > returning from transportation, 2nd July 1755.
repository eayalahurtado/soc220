Was he cast or acquitted ?', 'Mackwell. I heard the jury say, Guilty. *', "*See his former trial, No 414, in Sir Crisp Gascoyne's mayoralty.", "Turner. On the 9th of June last, the prisoner came to my shop, on the terras in St. James's-street. I keep a china-shop.", 'Q. Are you sure this is the man ?', "Turner. I have great reason to know him. He had another man with him. He was booted and spurr'd, and had a whip in his hand. He said, he wanted a pair of little pug-dogs to give his child to play with. I shew'd him all I had. I had one odd one; he fix'd particularly upon that, and would have an exact pair of such; and said, none would do but them, and desired I would get them for him, and he would come on Thursday following for them; but before he went away, he robb'd me of 18 guineas.", " \xa0                  James                   Tifford                                                                                        . I was at Mr. Turner's shop when the prisoner came there to cheapen some pug-dogs. The prisoner then desired he'd give him a guinea for some silver. Mr. Turner did; then he wanted him to let him have a King Charles's guinea in change for another. In the mean time his hands were busy in Mr. Turner's money, so as to take the quantity Mr. Turner has mentioned.", 'Court. He is not trying for that now. The question now is, was the prisoner at large?', 'Turner. Yes, my lord, he was. I took him to be a customer. When I found what he had done, I secured him. He offered me three guineas to let him go.', '                                                      Guilty            ,                                                          Death            .']
