', ' MR. DOANE conducted the Prosecution.', "  \xa0                                                                        WILLIAM HALE                  . I am a bootmaker, and live in York-street, Church-street, Shoreditch. On Monday, the 27th of April, 1829, I apprehended the prisoner—I was at that time headborough—I am sure she is the person—I took her into custody for robbing Mr. Todd, on the Pavement, Moorfields, and another person—I was present at the trial, and produce a record of her conviction and judgment, from Mr. Clark's office—I saw it signed by Mr. Clark, the clerk of this Court.", "  \xa0                                                                        JOHN ROPER                  . I believe the signature to this certificate to be Mr. Clark's handwriting.", "(The certificate was read, from which it appeared the prisoner had been convicted on two indictments, and sentenced to seven years' transportation on each.)", '  \xa0                                                                        WILLIAM HALE                   continued. I was present at both trials, and know her to be the person mentioned in the certificate—she appeared about fifteen or sixteen years old at that time—she is darker now than she was then, but I can speak positively to her, to a mark in her eye, by the side of her nose, and I have known all the family well some years.', ' Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know her before you took her up? A. Yes, I suppose for twelve months—she lived at Hoxton with her grandmother, about a quarter of a mile from me—I noticed the mark in her eye in 1829, and have carried it in my memory ever since-nobody sent me to take her up on this charge—I was sent for to identify her—I heard that Attfield had taken her into custody—I do not know who caused him to take her—I had not seen him before on the subject—I do not know the party that told me Attfield had taken her—I do not know a man named Sparks—I never saw him—I do not know such a name—I believe the name of the person who came and told me she was taken was Hunt—I do not know where he lives—he came to me at my own residence—I have seen him several times since—he is not here to my knowledge—I have met him in the street as lately as two days ago, I suppose—I', "did not see him yesterday or Saturday—I might have done so the day before—I saw him in Long-lane, in the street—I do not know his line of life—he came and desired me to go to Worship-treet—that was all the communication I had on the subject—he did not represent who he was or why he took any interest in it, nor who sent him—he asked if I knew such a person—I said I knew such a person, having her in custody, but I would not say she was the person until I saw her—I do not know a person going by the name of Jackson—I do not know the prisoner's husband—I never saw him to my knowledge, nor had any communication with him—I do not know that Hunt is not the prisoner's husband—I never saw Hunt write—I never met him in any public-house-nowhere but in the street and at my house, when he came to ask me if I remembered taking such a person—I never met him by appointment—I saw him at Worship-street when I went there—he was not in company with the officer—he stood by the side of the Magistrate—I am not the prosecutor of this indictment—the Government do not prosecute.", '  \xa0                                                                        WILLIAM ATTFIELD                  . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information I received on the 7th of last month, I apprehended the prisoner in Gloucester-street, Haggerstone in the street—I said, "Is your name Sarah Morris?"—she said, "No"—I said, "I believe it is, and you must go with me"—I told her she was charged on suspicion of having returned from transportation before the expiration of the term she was sent for—she said, "I am not the person"—I took her to a public-house at the corner, where I expected Hale to be—he had come with me, but was a little way off—he was in attendance there by my desire—I had received information from a man of the name of Walton—he also accompanied me and Hale—I took her to the public-house where Hale saw her, looked at her in the face for a minute, and said, "That is the woman, I know her very well," and he pointed out a mark at the corner of her eye—I took her to the station-house in a coach, in going along she cried a great deal, and begged hard for me to let her go, and said she would give me all she possessed in the world if I would let her go about her business.', ' Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a man named Sparks? A. I do not-Walton does not go by that name, nor by the name of Jackson—he did not go with me and point the woman out.', " COURT. Q. How came Walton to have an interest in the matter? A. I do not know whether he is clerk or assistant to Mr. Hunt—I understand Hunt is an attorney, but I have very little knowledge of him—I have seen him once or twice in cases at our office—I do not know the prisoner's husband, unless it was the person I saw once in company with Hunt, at a house close to Worship-street office-if Hunt was the cause of her being apprehended, he must have instructed Walton to direct me where to find her—I believe Hunt lives in Great Leonard-street, Shoreditch, but I cannot say the number.", ' JURY to WILLIAM HALE. Q. What is the mark in the eye? A. Something of a wart that has been just by the side of the nose—it is a scar—I have not examined it, and cannot say whether it is a hole or a lump—it is a scar—it was dark when I identified her first—I could have identified her by her features.', '                                                                                       NOT GUILTY                  .']
