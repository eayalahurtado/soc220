I produce a certificate from Mr. Clark's office—(read: Central Criminal Court, Henry Palmer, Convicted Oct., 1847, of stealing a purse and money from the person of Elizabeth Delamere; transported for ten years)—I know the prisoner; he is the man named in the certificate.", " Cross-examined by MR. SLEIGH. Q. Were you present at the trial? A. Yes; he was convicted with some others of street robbery—he was sworn to by a police constable named Jenkinson—it was partly on Jenkinson's evidence that he was convicted—I have heard that Jenkinson has been discharged from the police, but do not know that it was on account of his having been convicted of perjury.", '  \xa0                                                                        JOHN DAVIS WHITE                  , I am chief warder on board the Warrior convict hulk, at Woolwich—in 1847, I was principal warder, and had the prisoner in my custody under sentence of transportation—he escaped from the public works on 18th Sept., 1849, and I have not seen him since—I am positive he is the man, I had him in my custody two years—a man named Slater escaped at the same time; we have never heard of him since.', "  \xa0                                                                        JAMES BRANNAN                   (police inspector, G). On Saturday, 9th June, about 9 o'clock, I was in the Hackney-road, and saw the prisoner coming along Great Cambridge-street; he saw me, and immediately ran away—I ran after him with other constables.", ' COURT. Q. Had you had anything to do with his previous conviction? A. Not with what he was transported for, but I had him in custody before his transportation—I have known him from his boyhood; he is about thirty-three years old; I have done duty in that neighbourhood twenty-four years—I took him after a desperate resistance—I told him that I took him for escaping from the Warrior hulk; he said that he was never there in his life—while on the ground he took a signet ring from his finger, and I saw him swallow it—I have not got it again.', '(James Pocock, a carpenter; John Roland, a smith, of No. 2, Walbrook-row, ', " Hoxton; and Thomas Birch, a cabinet maker, of No. 74, Old-street, St. Luke's, gave the prisoner a good character.)", ' GUILTY.
