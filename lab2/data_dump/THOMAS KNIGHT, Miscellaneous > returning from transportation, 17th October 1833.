I produce a certificate of the prisoner\'s conviction and judgment from Mr. Clark\'s office; I saw Mr. Clark sign it; (read) - on the 16th of September I saw the prisoner in the parish of St. Pancras, in Little Albany-mews, at work at a hackneyman\'s; he was at large - Limbrick was with me; I asked him his name; he said, Peter Thompson, or Thomas, I do not know which; I said, "Tom, do not you know me?" - I had known him before well for several years, at Westminster; he made no answer, and Limbrick and I brought him out of the stables into a public-house, and while we were handcuffing him at the public-house he said, "Pace, it is no use to deny it, I know what you want me for;" I said, we wanted him for returning from transportation before his time; he said, it was useless to deny it; he knew me and I knew him - we brought him away.', ' \xa0                  THOMAS                   LIMBRICK                                                                                       .

I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell. I was present when the prisoner was tried, and I took him - I am sure he is the man who was convicted of that felony - I have known him nearly all his life.", "Prisoner's Defence (written). About six years ago I was convicted at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to be transported for life, when I was sent to New South Wales, at which place I arrived about five years and a half ago: when I got there I was taken into the service of Mr. Bodman, an auctioneer, resident there; I continued in his service only a few weeks, and after that time he gave me a little liberty, for this reason - as I was in my bed I was awakened by a noise in the back kitchen which was occasioned by two men breaking into his house, I got up and alarmed the master and the rest of the family; my master's clerk fired at one of the men out of the window, when they ran off, and were seen no more. In a few days afterwards I had occasion to go out upon some business for my master, when I was stopped by two men, who threatened to take my life away if they caught me going about after dark; when I returned I acquainted my master with it, and he told me he would see if something could not be done for me: on the Sunday following he gave me a new suit of clothes, and told me I might have a little liberty; I was afterwards persuaded by a friend to go on board of the New Zealand schooner bound for the River Thames, at New Zealand; when I got on board I went to work for the captain, who told me, if I would sail with him he would give me Â£3 current money, per month, which offer I accepted; when we were cleared out I answered to my name at the custom-house, and I considered that my master had done something for me, as there was no objection to my going away in the New Zealand. I was away from Sidney about seven weeks, when I returned with a cargo of flax and Indian corn. I remained at Sidney about thirteen days, and was paid off there; and then I joined the New Zealand schooner again, when we went to a place called the Bay of Islands, where the crew left her. When I left the schooner I went into the service of Mr. Fishwick, a settler of New Zealand; after I left the service of Mr. Fishwick I then shipped on board the ship Thetis, of London, sperm whaler, bound for the Coast of Japan, Captain                \xa0                  Andrew                   Gray                                                                                       , to be discharged at the Sandwich Islands, by my own request; and I had an order upon Mr. Soames for my money; I then went into the service of Mr. Owen; I remained with him about eleven months, when leaving his service I had an offer to ship on board of the brig Alfred, which I accepted, as servant to Captain                \xa0Loller            , the brig being bound to the Society Islands, and from thence Valparaiso; on her passage to the Society Islands I was cast away at the Island Tippowhie when I remained with the natives, living with them for three months in a state of nakedness, as we were completely stripped by them; at length the missionaries' schooner came down to our assistance, and we remained with him, Mr. Pritchard, until we had freighted the brig Doll, and I went in her to Fee Gee, and to Manilla, and China, and there I got paid off. I remained in China about three months when I shipped on board the Tremont, of Boston, Captain Russell Sturgess, bound for England and from thence to Germany, there I remained, by my own request, about six weeks, and then I returned to England again, where I have remained ever since; and when the people took me into custody, they found me at work in the stable belonging to the master that I have been working for ever since I came home. I have always considered myself a freeman, as I was cleared out of the Customs and Police at Sidney twice, andSee original\xa0likewise, my master, Mr. Bodman and my brother, who was at that time living as second coachman to his late majesty                \xa0George             the Fourth, promised to do all they could for me, and I supposed they had done so.", '                                                      GUILTY             -                                                          DEATH            .
