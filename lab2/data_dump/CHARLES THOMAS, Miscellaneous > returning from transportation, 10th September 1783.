Will the witness take upon him to swear, that I cut Mr. Seasons? - Seasons and the prisoner were engaged particularly together; he struck the first blow, and nobody but him could strike Seasons.', 'Court.

Gentlemen, the indictment charges the prisoner with returning from transportation and being at large, it is therefore incumbent upon him, to shew to the Court and Jury, that he had some lawful, or reasonable cause for that purpose; now had this man been in a tempest at sea, and been obliged to come on shore, that would, I conceive, have been a reasonable and lawful excuse, in which case, he would have surrendered himself to a peace officer as soon as possible, but so far from any such colour, this man stood in opposition to the officers of Justice, armed himself, acted with violence, and said, he would rather die than be taken, so that that excludes any possible idea of a lawful cause of being at large.', '                                                      GUILTY            ,                                                          Death            .', 'Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.']
