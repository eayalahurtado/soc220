My lord, it is not with the intent of denying my charge, that I pleaded not guilty, but humbly hoping there are some circumstances in my case, that deserves your lordship's commiseration. At Westminster quarter sessions I was tried for the attempt of stealing a pocket handkerchief, by only moving the pocket handkerchief from one pocket to another; since my return, which is about fourteen months, I have had the satisfaction to say, that no police officer, or any other, can lay the slightest charge to me; I was, forSee original\xa0the first ten months in the country, residing on my friends' bounty, since then I lodged at Mrs. Hoare's, Blackfriers, never quitting her house till seven in the evening to enjoy the fresh air, and invariably returning at nine o'clock. I am by trade a glass-cutter, and should have ever been a useful member to society; I therefore humbly implore implore your Lordship to recommend me.
