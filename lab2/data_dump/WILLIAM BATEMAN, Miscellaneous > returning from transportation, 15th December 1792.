As soon as I was paid off from there, I went on board his majesty's Speedy Frigate, and had the Yarmouth station to keep out of the way; I went from thence directly to France, where I staid till these distresses happened, when I was obliged to come to England, and that was the way I was taken. If I knew where the captain lived, I know I could get a good character; I took two prizes while I was on board the Speedy Frigate. I was obliged to come to England, or else I never should.
