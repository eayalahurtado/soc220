James's Clerkenwell                                                      , was indicted for                                                          returning from Transportation, without lawful Cause, before the Expiration of seven Years            .

Several Sailors appeared to prove that he was on board the said Ship; but he could bring none to swear that he was press'd. The Jury found him                                     guilty            .                                                          Death            ."]
