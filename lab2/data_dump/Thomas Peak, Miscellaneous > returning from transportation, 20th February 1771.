On the 13th of January, the day after Mr. Stratford's house was broke open in Grosvenor Square, I dispatched several persons different ways in order to look after the things stolen. I went into Gravel Lane, Houndsditch. I had been at several houses before I went there; to the house of one Valentine, who is a receiver of stolen goods. I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire; Heley and my brother was with me. I said, What Peak, are you here, I am sorry to find you here. He was then standing by the fire, he stood very much confused, and desired we would take him to his father's; he has often been desired to keep out of the way. I insisted upon their taking him to Whitechapel immediately.", ' \xa0                  Richard                   Bond                                                                                       .
