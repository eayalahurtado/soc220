I am sure he is the same person; he lived with Sir Watkin two years; I both hired and discharged him. On the 4th of September, just as I had finished my dinner, I was informed there was somebody upon the hay, in the hay-barn, which is a very large place, containing fifty or sixty tons of hay, it was filled but the Saturday before; we searched the barn, and in about an hour found the prisoner concealed in the hay: this was in the parish of Rhuabon, in the county of Denbigh. He said, he landed at Liverpool, and was on his journey to his father's; that he concealed himself there till night, because he was afraid to travel by day. We had him committed; and afterwards removed him to town. He was examined at Bow-street, and there he confessed that he landed at Blackwall.", " \xa0                  John                   Harris                                                                                       .
