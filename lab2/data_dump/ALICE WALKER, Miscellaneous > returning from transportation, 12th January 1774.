I did not call him by his name; he bid me pull off my bonnet that he might see my face; I took my bonnet off, and then he said he believed he knew something of me; I never called him by his name; a man in the prison told me Howard would make it up, if I would advance some money.', "- Lee. I went down to lock the women's side; she said Mr. Lee, what do you think will become of me?
