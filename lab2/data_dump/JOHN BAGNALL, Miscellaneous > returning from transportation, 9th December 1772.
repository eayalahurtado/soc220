I was at Nottingham when the prisoner was tried; he was convicted, and I saw him receive sentence and after that I saw him with the rest of the transports go on board the ship at Iron Gate near the Tower; and I saw him at large on the 25th of September, about a month after the assize, in Mutton-lane, or I believe it is Vine-street, near Hatton-Wall.', 'Q.

The captain when he went away, said he was to return in about four or five months; I went to the merchant; he said the ship had met with an accident, and I need not enquire farther after it, for on account of its not returning, he had been obliged to contract with another ship.', ' \xa0                  Sarah                   Blake                                                                                       .
