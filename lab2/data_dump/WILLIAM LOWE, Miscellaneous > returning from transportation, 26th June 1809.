My lord and gentlemen of the jury, impressed with deep respect to this honourable court and jury, before whom I am tried; I accepted of his majesty's most gracious pardon in admitting me to go for a soldier. I do solemnly declare that had I been dealt with in that kind of way which I was at first, I never should have thought of returning until my time was out. When I consented to go for a soldier I understood it to be for seven years; when I came to the prison ship of the Isle of Wight I was told that I was to be a soldier for life; I had no idea that his Majesty exercised his prerogative to make me a soldier for life. I never was sworn in for a soldier, that part was omitted in my case, and is with most unfortunate men in my situation. Finding I was to be a soldier for life I resolved upon coming to London again; I was not taken in any felonious act, nor did I intend to shun the laws of my country. If unfortunate transports are to be made soldiers for life, why are they not told that they are to be soldiers for life. I humbly implore the mercy and tenderness of the court in my favour, that if I am sent for a soldier, to have no longer period to serve than I was led to believe at first, and I will ever pray,                \xa0                  William                   Lowe                                                                                       .", 'GUILTY -                                                          DEATH            , aged 34.', "[                                                         The prisoner was recommended to his Majesty's mercy by the jury, believing he did not like to be subject to martial laws            .]", 'First Middlesex jury, before Mr. justice Chambre.']
